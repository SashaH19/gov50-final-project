## Introduction
Whenever a vacancy arises in a federal district court judgeship, the President and Senate have respective responsibilities of nominating and confirming candidates. There are few formal restrictions on who can be nominated, but customarily, the candidates for these positions are chosen in consultation with the senators of the home state in which the district is located. To illustrate this practice, if a vacancy arises in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, the President will consult with the senators from Tennessee. If the senators are of the same political party as the President, the state senators will typically identify candidates for nomination. Even if the senators are not of the same party, it remains customary to still consult both home state Senators to determine acceptability of the candidate (Steven Rutkus, 2016). 

Given the often partisan nature of these proceedings, I intend to evaluate whether the political party of a ruling judge has any impact on the average case outcome for or against defendants / petitioners, specifically for cases concerning issues that may be partisan. Using data from federal district courts, I will divide the cases by category, looking at issues that may be more politicized, such as alien petitions or free speech. I then will analyze if there is a statistically significant difference in average ruling between Democrat and Republican judges. I hypothesize that the political party of the judge deciding the case will have some correlation with the outcome of a case, and that on average, Democrats will be more likely than Republicans to rule in favor a defendant or petitioner.

## Data
To analyze my hypotheses, I employ the U.S. District Court Database dataset by Robert Carp and Kenneth Manning. The dataset is an observational cross-section, and contains virtually all federal district court decisions published since 1933 in which holdings can be interpreted through a binary (e.g. for or against petitioner, for or against free speech). The dataset contains information by case including judge party affiliation, how the case was decided (against or in favor of the defendant/petitioner), and the category of case. 

I first divide the cases by category, and select several categories often discussed in relation to partisan politics like alien petitions, which concern petitions by non-citizens who might wish to immigrate to the US, freedom of expression, and environmental protection. Then, grouping by party, I measure the average of an outcome variable, which is whether a case is decided in favor of a defendant / petitioner (=1) or against (=0). An average nearing 0 in this index demonstrates a higher average of deciding against, while an average nearing 1 indicates a higher average of deciding in favor. To consider more recent trends and political issues, I filter the dataset to only include the years 2000-2012 and politicized case categories.

```
The above plot takes federal district court cases from 2000-2012 and divides them by categories of alien petitions(immigration procedure), criminal court motions (anything having to do with procedure of a criminal trial), environmental protection, freedom of expression, freedom of religion, and racial discrimination. Facially, the graph implies that on average, cases decided by judges who are Democrats are more often decided in favor of the defendant or petitioner than those decided by Republicans. This appears especially true for the categories of alien petitions and criminal court motions. The freedom of expression category does not appear to have as much partisan difference. 

## Results
Does a deciding judge's political party have any statistically significant correlation with case outcome?

Partisan Average Outcomes in Alien Petition Cases

Regression: After running a linear regression for alien petition cases, the Y intercept is 0.491 when the ruling judge's political party is not Republican, or conversely, when the judge is a Democrat. This indicates that on the 0-1 index of ruling against or in favor of a petitioner, Democrat judges have an average ruling outcome of 0.491 points. This means that if a Democrat judge were to become Republican, there would be an expected -0.164 point decrease in average case outcome in favor of a defendant / petitioner. The median of the bootstrap distribution appears to be centered around this point difference.

Null hypothesis: After taking the difference in means for case outcome by party, we create a bootstrap distribution with repeated sampling of this difference. A 95% confidence interval is employed, shown by the two vertical lines on the graph. A 95% confidence interval means that across the repeated samples, the true value of difference in case outcome by political party will fall within the interval. If there is no difference at all, which would be our null hypothesis, this would be indicated by 0 falling within the confidence interval. However, this does not happen above, leading us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between alien petition cases decided by Republican and Democrat judges.

Partisan Average outcomes in Criminal Court Motions

Regression: After running a linear regression for Criminal Court Motion cases, the Y intercept is 0.410 when the ruling judge's political party is not Republican, or conversely, when the judge is a Democrat. This indicates that on the 0-1 index of ruling against or in favor of a petitioner, Democrat judges have an average ruling outcome of 0.410 points. This means that if a Democrat judge were to become Republican, there would be an expected -0.125 point decrease in average case outcome in favor of a defendant / petitioner. The median of the bootstrap distribution appears to be centered around this point difference.

Null hypothesis: After taking the difference in means for case outcome by party, we create a bootstrap distribution with repeated sampling of this difference. A 95% confidence interval is employed, shown by the two vertical lines on the graph. A 95% confidence interval means that across the repeated samples, the true value of difference in case outcome by political party will fall within the interval. If there is no difference at all, which would be our null hypothesis, this would be indicated by 0 falling within the confidence interval. However, this does not happen above, leading us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between Criminal Court Motion cases decided by Republican and Democrat judges.

Partisan Average Outcomes in Environmental Protection Cases

Regression: After running a linear regression for Environmental Protection cases, the Y intercept is 0.635 when the ruling judge's political party is not Republican, or conversely, when the judge is a Democrat. This indicates that on the 0-1 index of ruling against or in favor of a petitioner, Democrat judges have an average ruling outcome of 0.635 points. This means that if a Democrat judge were to become Republican, there would be an expected -0.117 point decrease in average case outcome in favor of a defendant / petitioner. The median of the bootstrap distribution appears to be centered around this point difference.

Null hypothesis: After taking the difference in means for case outcome by party, we create a bootstrap distribution with repeated sampling of this difference. A 95% confidence interval is employed, shown by the two vertical lines on the graph. A 95% confidence interval means that across the repeated samples, the true value of difference in case outcome by political party will fall within the interval. If there is no difference at all, which would be our null hypothesis, this would be indicated by 0 falling within the confidence interval. However, this does not happen above, leading us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between Environmental Protection cases decided by Republican and Democrat judges.

Partisan Average Outcomes in Freedom of Expression Cases

Regression: After running a linear regression for Environmental Protection cases, the Y intercept is 0.583 when the ruling judge's political party is not Republican, or conversely, when the judge is a Democrat. This indicates that on the 0-1 index of ruling against or in favor of a petitioner, Democrat judges have an average ruling outcome of 0.583 points. This means that if a Democrat judge were to become Republican, there would be an expected -0.044 point decrease in average case outcome in favor of a defendant / petitioner. The median of the bootstrap distribution appears to be centered around this point difference. Compared to other categories of cases, the difference in case outcome by judge party, is very slim.

Null hypothesis: After taking the difference in means for case outcome by party, we create a bootstrap distribution with repeated sampling of this difference. A 95% confidence interval is employed, shown by the two vertical lines on the graph. A 95% confidence interval means that across the repeated samples, the true value of difference in case outcome by political party will fall within the interval. If there is no difference at all, which would be our null hypothesis, this would be indicated by 0 falling within the confidence interval. This DOES happen here, with 0 falling with the lower and upper bounds. Thus, we should fail to reject the null hypothesis and as such, cannot find a statistically significant difference between judge parties in freedom of expression cases.

Partisan Average Outcomes in Freedom of Religion Cases

Regression: After running a linear regression for Environmental Protection cases, the Y intercept is 0.610 when the ruling judge's political party is not Republican, or conversely, when the judge is a Democrat. This indicates that on the 0-1 index of ruling against or in favor of a petitioner, Democrat judges have an average ruling outcome of 0.610 points. This means that if a Democrat judge were to become Republican, there would be an expected -0.151 point decrease in average case outcome in favor of a defendant / petitioner. The median of the bootstrap distribution appears to be centered around this point difference.

Null hypothesis: After taking the difference in means for case outcome by party, we create a bootstrap distribution with repeated sampling of this difference. A 95% confidence interval is employed, shown by the two vertical lines on the graph. A 95% confidence interval means that across the repeated samples, the true value of difference in case outcome by political party will fall within the interval. If there is no difference at all, which would be our null hypothesis, this would be indicated by 0 falling within the confidence interval. However, this does not happen above, leading us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between Environmental Protection cases decided by Republican and Democrat judges.

Partisan Average Outcomes in Racial Discrimination Cases

Regression: After running a linear regression for Environmental Protection cases, the Y intercept is 0.355 when the ruling judge's political party is not Republican, or conversely, when the judge is a Democrat. This indicates that on the 0-1 index of ruling against or in favor of a petitioner, Democrat judges have an average ruling outcome of 0.355 points. This means that if a Democrat judge were to become Republican, there would be an expected -0.090 point decrease in average case outcome in favor of a defendant / petitioner. The median of the bootstrap distribution appears to be centered around this point difference.

Null hypothesis: After taking the difference in means for case outcome by party, we create a bootstrap distribution with repeated sampling of this difference. A 95% confidence interval is employed, shown by the two vertical lines on the graph. A 95% confidence interval means that across the repeated samples, the true value of difference in case outcome by political party will fall within the interval. If there is no difference at all, which would be our null hypothesis, this would be indicated by 0 falling within the confidence interval. However, this does not happen above, leading us to conclude that there is a statistically significant difference between Environmental Protection cases decided by Republican and Democrat judges. 

## Conclusion
With the exception of freedom of expression, all of the other categories had statistically significant differences in outcome depending on whether the ruling judge was a Democrat or Republican. Within the freedom of expression cases, any partisan difference was minimal and not statistically significant. There are likely a multitude of reasons for this, but among them may be the vast field of legal precedents surrounding freedom of speech and expression cases. Through Supreme Court cases like "Brandenburg v. Ohio" and "United States v. O'Brien," there are established legal tests that must be applied by lower courts whenever legal cases involving expression occur. In applying these tests and considering the field of legal precedent, this category may be an area where lower courts like Federal District Courts are not able to exercise as much discretion as would be found in other areas (e.g. Criminal Court Motions and Alien Petitions).

While most categories did show statistical significance, this can only be seen as correlation, not causal. There are a number of possible confounding variables that might be identified here. For example, consider the partisan process of appointing judges, as well as the likelihood that certain cases may occur more frequently in different areas of the country. Border states and majority Republican states like Texas may receive more alien petition cases than states in the Northeastern US, and because of the appointment process, judges in Texas may also skew Republican.  Another potential confounder is the judge itself. A judge may be influenced by their personal beliefs in their rulings, and it may be their personal beliefs that lead them to align with a particular political party. Thus, it would be impossible, at least within the scope of this dataset, to ascribe a causal relationship between judge political party and case ruling.

If I had more time and resources to expand this analysis, instead of looking only at Federal District Court Data, I would also like to look at the data of lower courts, including trial courts. This would give a larger sample size, and given that lower court judges are often elected instead of nominated, might offer another perspective on the interaction between judgeships and political party. However, even if we were to expand the sample data, it might be complicated to reliably discern the party of a judge. Even if judges are technically registered under one party, this may not be reality or a consistent indicator of their values. 

Thus, while there appears to be a statistically significant difference in case rulings based on political party, excepting freedom of expression, given the number of confounding variables and possible inconsistencies, this is at most, a correlation. And while the above analysis points to a correlation, because there are many potential confounding variables, it would only be in the best interest of this analysis to expand sample data so as to control for confounders and establish stronger evidence of a correlation.
